# An-Efficient-Approach-to-Stamp-Verification
This project presents a practical approach for stamp verification, based on the 3 stages: Stamp segmentation, classification stamp or non-stamp and stamp authenticity verification. In each stage, this work tries and tests new algorithms/methods to give a new way of solving all of the problem.
This project is my graduation thesis, me and a friend of mine work together with the help of our two instructors. We manage to get acceptance to publish our work in a computer science magazine by publisher “Springer”.
